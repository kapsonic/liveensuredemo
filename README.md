# LiveEnsure Python SDK

This is the LiveEnsure® Python DEMO SDK for LiveEnsure Authentication (www.liveensure.com)
>From this SDK you will be able to launch a full API stack in Django and demonstrate the 
full capabilities of LiveEnsure® Authentication for web, cloud, apps and mobile.

The SDK is provided to illustrate how to integrate LiveEnsure® with your identity, web or
app platforms. For futher information, visit the SDK docs at http://developer.liveensure.com 

You will need to obtain LiveEnsure® developer API keys to test this API and sign up for a 
paid LiveEnsure service subscription to use the API/SDK in production. 

This SDK functions in desktop-browser and mobile-browser (app to app) modes, depending on how
you access the pages. From a desktop, you will scan with the free LiveEnsure app to authenticate
based on the settings you configure to drive the API. If you acccess the pages from your mobile
device, the SDK will behave in an app-to-app fashion, rolling over to authenticate as in an app
or mobile HTML implementation, without providing or requiring a scan step. 

For questions about this SDK or LiveEnsure® authentication, visit support.liveensure.com 

## Getting Started

* **First,** sign up at http://www.liveensure.com/signup.html for your developer API keys.
* **Second,** download the free LiveEnsure app for iOS or Android http://www.liveensure.com/app.html
* **Third,** download, configure and run this SDK on your local or networked machine as instructed.

### Prerequisites

Below packages need to be installed and configured:
- network accessible server (or virtual instance)
- Python 2.7+, Django - 1.10.2, requests-2.10.0.
- Obtain LiveEnsure® developer API keys by signup (http://www.liveensure.com/signup.html) and then click the link "Send me my credentials by email" after login
- Google MAP api key (optional for location factors)

### Installing

To install `liveensuredemo` app, run the following command
    
    pip install -e git+https://github.com/LiveEnsure/PythonDjangoSDK#egg=liveensuredemo

### Configuration

* Add following names to INSTALLED_APPS in your settings (`settings.py`) like this:
```
  INSTALLED_APPS = [
     ...
     'liveensuredemo',
     'sslserver'
   ]
```

* Include the app URLconf in your project urls.py like this:

```
  url(r'^liveensure/', include('liveensuredemo.urls')),
```

* Include following setting in your `settings.py` file:

```    
LIVE_ENSURE = {
  "API_KEY": "<API key for liveensure>",
  "API_PASSWORD": "<API password>",
  "AGENT_ID": "<Agent ID for liveensure>",
  "API_HOST": "<API host to access liveensure API>",
  "GOOGLE_MAP_KEY": "<Optional Google Map key to access map to run location auth demo>"
}

```

* This app uses session to store session data, if django installation is new and migrations were never run, then run the migrations using:

```    
python manage.py migrate
```

* Start server on specific port to access app using below command:

```
python manage.py runsslserver 0.0.0.0:8000
```


## Running the SDK

Explain how to launch, run the automated tests for this system
Make sure you cover how to bind Django to extenral IP so they
can see it from their phone if need be (ifconig -a, find IP, etc)

### Desktop/Browser Authentication via Mobile Scan

Walk through each factor and how to test/engage desktop with mobile

```
Give an examples
```

### App to App Mobile Authentication via App Only

Walk thorugh each factor and how to test/engage from mobile only

```
Give an examples
```

## Using the SDK with your own stack/app/code

To use the SDK in your own code, You can copy `api.py` in your own stack. It is a class based
implementaton of all the api, which internally calls the liveensure API using `requests`.

This can be used as follows:
- Create LiveEnsure object

```  
  # api_key is the API key for liveensure
  # api_password is the API password for liveensure 
  # agent_id is the Agent ID for liveensure
  # host_to_access_API is the Host location where API's are hosted
  
  # Make sure you have all these keys before you start using the APIs
  
  liveAuthObj = LiveEnsure("<api_key>", "<api_password>", "<agent_id>", "<host_to_access_api>")
```

- Start session

```      
  # email is the userid for which authentication is to be done

  liveAuthObj.initSession("<email>")
```

  It will return JSON object which have the `sessionToken`, that will be used in all subsequent calls.
  

- Add factors
    * Add knowledge challenge

          ```          
            # question is the question to be asked after scanning the code
            # answer is the answer to the question 
            # session Token is the session key that is returned by initSession call.
    
            liveAuthObj.addPromptChallenge('<question>', '<answer>', '<sessionToken>')
          ```

      It will return json object with status of the API call.

    * Add location challenge

          ```
            # lat is lattitude of location
            # lang is the langitude of the location
            # radius is the radius limit of location authentication
            
            liveAuthObj.addPromptChallenge('<lat>', '<lang>', <radius>, '<sessionToken>')
          ```

    * Add behaviour challenge
          
          ```
            # orientation is the orientation of mobile phone used to scan the 
            # code. It can have 4 values range from 0 to 3
            # 0 -> Portrait
            # 1 -> Upside down
            # 2 -> Landscape Left
            # 3 -> Landscape Right
            
            # touches number of touch points up to 6
            liveAuthObj.addTouchChallenge('<orientation>', '<touches>', '<sessionToken>')
          ```
- Get the code

```
liveAuthObj.getAuthObj("<TYPE>", "<sessionToken>")
```

- poll for status

```      
liveAuthObj.pollStatus('<sessionToken>')
```

- delete user

```    
  # email: email of the user that is to be deleted
  liveAuthObj.deleteUser('<email>')
```
